## API Integration

The system provides a comprehensive REST API for programmatic user management:

- `POST /api/users` - Create new user

### Authentication
All API requests require:

## JavaScript Integration

The system includes a JavaScript module for frontend integration:

```javascript
// Initialize user management
const userManagement = new UserManagement();

// Get all users
userManagement.getUsers()
  .then(users => console.log(users))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Create user
userManagement.createUser({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'securepassword',
  password_confirmation: 'securepassword',
  role: 'Petugas'
})
.then(result => console.log(result))
