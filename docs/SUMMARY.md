- **CRUD Operations:** Full device lifecycle management

### 2. Monitoring System
- **Connectivity Checks:** Ping-based device status verification
- **Performance Metrics:** Response time measurements
- **Historical Logging:** Comprehensive status history
- **Cascading Effects:** Parent device down affects children automatically

### 3. Alert Management
- **Automatic Generation:** Alerts created on status changes
- **Resolution Tracking:** Mark alerts as resolved
- **Priority Levels:** Critical, warning, and informational alerts
- **Notification System:** Dashboard indicators and future email/SMS

### 4. Reporting Engine
- **Dashboard Analytics:** Real-time statistics and trends
- **Performance Charts:** Interactive data visualization
- **PDF Generation:** Printable reports with customizable date ranges
- **Export Capabilities:** Data export in multiple formats

### 5. User Management
- **Role-based Access:** Admin and Petugas roles with distinct permissions
- **Authentication:** Secure login with password reset
- **Profile Management:** User account customization
- **Activity Logging:** Audit trails for administrative actions

## 📊 Data Models

### Device Model
Stores information about network devices:
- Name, IP address, type, and location
- Hierarchical parent-child relationships
- Current status and last check timestamp
- Active/inactive flag for monitoring control

### DeviceLog Model
Records historical device status:
- Response time measurements
- Status (up/down) with timestamps
- Linked to parent device for reporting

### Alert Model
Tracks system notifications:
- Associated device and status change
- Active/resolved state tracking
- Creation and resolution timestamps

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for brute force prevention

### Authorization
- Role-based access control with Spatie Laravel Permission
- Fine-grained permissions for specific actions
- Policy-based resource protection

### Data Protection
- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM
